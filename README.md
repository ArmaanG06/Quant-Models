# Quantitative Option Pricing Models ðŸ“ˆ

A modular Python project implementing both **Black-Scholes** and **Monte Carlo simulation** methods for pricing European options. Designed to demonstrate theoretical understanding, numerical techniques, and practical coding ability â€” all in one cohesive quant-dev toolkit.

---

## Project Overview

This project consists of two independent, production-ready pricing engines:

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `black_scholes/` | Analytical pricing using the Black-Scholes model, including Greeks and implied volatility solver |
| `monte_carlo/`   | Simulation-based pricing using Geometric Brownian Motion and Monte Carlo techniques |

These modules are testable, extensible, and suitable for integration into larger trading or research systems.

## Sample Output

```bash
=== Option Pricing Comparison ===
Underlying: 100, Strike: 100, T: 1.0, r: 0.05, Ïƒ: 0.2, Type: call
[Black-Scholes] Price: 10.4506
[Monte Carlo]   Price: 10.2211
Difference: 0.2295
```
Plots generated include:
- Simulated price paths
- Final price distribution (S_T)
- Discounted payoff histograms
